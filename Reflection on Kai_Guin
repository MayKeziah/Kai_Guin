Reflection on Kai_Guin
Objective before: 
	To install C++, learn enough syntax to manage, and sort an array of objects we defined (from a file) and writing them to a file.

Our Successes:
1. We actually installed C++
	a. Issues:
		1) Deciding on an IDE: What does Bothell use?
		2) Deciding on a compiler: What does Bothell use?
		3) Knowing what options to select. 
		4) Following a tutorial for a different IDE and compiler.
	b. Helpful tools: 
		1) YouTube tutorial for installing IDE and Compiler for C++.

		2) xx
2. We got through 5 hours of a great tutorial!
	<insert link here>
3. We all designed objects.
4. We filled an array with objects.

Our Shortcomings:
1. Cheng and I were unable to link our .hpp and .cpp files at runtime. We researched for hours before deciding to cheat our way through it using bad sytax. 
2. We were unable to finish writing a sorting algorithm. 
3. We were unable to read / write files.

How C++ is different from what we knew:
	1. Input and output syntax
	2. #include
	3. includePath
	4. Configurations / JSON
	5. Extensions / many more things were manually controlled. 
	6. Header (.hpp) interface for all classes stays seperate from the class body.
	7. Location specifiers for every part of a class body.
	8. #ifndef, #define, #endif.
	9. Pointer objects.
	10. File linking / makeFile.
	11. Simplistic IDE (low clutter) vscode.
	12. Comment syntax.
	13. Call to default constructor with no parameters.
	14. Constructors that overload themself with default values. 
	15. using namespace std;
	16. Comment headers stick with the defined block across files. (this is same)
	17. Constant vs final constant functions.
	18. Console vs terminal of your choice.
	19. ~Deconstructor()'s
	20. The order of deconstruction in an array of user defined objects.
	21. String concatenation bad across types.
	22. array.sizeOf() / array[i].sizeOf() = array.length
	23. srand(time(0));

In summary:
	For the next hack-a-thon, we want to be:
	 1) more goal oriented
	 2) set a plan for tackling our goals
	 3) reward brainstorming
	 4) reward reflection
	 5) reward every small thing you learned or accomplished
	 6) Plan to bring our lessons back to the community
	 7) Have fun!
	 8) decompress! Bond over activity!
